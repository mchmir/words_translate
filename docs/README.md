# Search for unique words in the text and their translation.

Projects:  Search for unique words in the text and compile a dictionary with the ability to translate these words into any language.

My friends have asked me to create a program to help them learn a foreign language through thematic texts. I.e., you copy the reader into the input file, the script processes it and generates a new file with words and, if necessary, with translation. Prepositions and articles are excluded from the analysis.

When forming unique words, the word is not brought to its fundamental basis(lemma) but is used as it occurs in the text (from the project requirements).

If you don't need translation of words, the text will be analyzed, and a file of unique words will be generated.
The first line of the output file contains the number of unique words, excluding prepositions, articles, and code patterns.
