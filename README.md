# words_translate
Search for unique words in the text and their translation.

Code review: (small project) Search for unique words in the text and compile a dictionary with the ability to translate these words into any language.
Many people have asked me to create a program to help them learn a foreign language through thematic texts. I.e., you copy the reader into the input file, the script processes it and generates a new file with words and, if necessary, with translation. Prepositions and articles are excluded from the analysis.
If you don't need translation of words, the text will be analyzed, and a file of unique words will be generated. 
The first line of the output file contains the number of unique words, excluding prepositions, articles, and code patterns.
