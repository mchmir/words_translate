In this tutorial, I’m going to talk about list comprehensions. List comprehensions are actually one of my favorite features in Python. I know they can seem a little bit arcane at first or a little bit strange, but they are actually super helpful. They can help make your programs easier to read and easier to maintain, once you’ve actually wrapped your head around how they work.
And when you break them down to their first principles, they are relatively easy to understand. Behind the scenes, it’s pretty much all just for loops, and that’s what I’m going to teach you in this tutorial.
